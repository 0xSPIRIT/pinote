TODO - pinote
=============

We want to have a system that stores notes using markdown.
You can store images & video through a media subfolder.

Whenever you insert an image in-place, it checks to see
if a media/ subdirectory exists. If not, it creates it,
and uploads it to the server there.

There's a file picker dialog that allows you to see the
whole file structure, create subfolders, and create /
load notes.

This whole thing would be run on a Raspberry Pi server,
so I can access my journals from anywhere in the world,
especially since I'm going to Canada soon for my exchange
semester. I'll have the Pi running at home, and I'd be
able to access it, or SSH into it if I need to diagnose
any issues.
